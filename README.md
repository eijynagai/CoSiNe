# CoSiNe: Communities in Signed Networks

Welcome to the official repository of **CoSiNe**, a tool under development to explore **signed gene co-expression networks**, with a particular focus on single-cell transcriptomic data. For **Updates and final release** please drop me an email eijynagai [at] gmail.com.

## Overview
This project aims to provide robust methods for:

- **signedLFR**: Generating synthetic signed networks with known community structures using an extended version of the classical LFR benchmark.
- **CoSiNe**: Detecting communities in signed graphs using LouvainSigned, our Louvain algorithm adapted to supports both positive and negative edge weights. Downstream analysis of the communities identified including marker genes identification, GO terms enrichment analysis,
