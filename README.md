# CoSiNe: Communities in Signed Networks

Welcome to the official repository of **CoSiNe**, a tool under development to explore **signed gene co-expression networks**, with a particular focus on single-cell transcriptomic data. For **Updates and final release** please drop me an email eijynagai [at] gmail.com.

## Overview
This project aims to provide robust methods for:

- **signedLFR**: Generating synthetic signed networks with known community structures using an extended version of the classical LFR benchmark.
- **CoSiNe**: Detecting communities in signed graphs using LouvainSigned, our Louvain algorithm adapted to supports both positive and negative edge weights. Workflow includes useful analyses for the communities of genes: marker genes identification, KEGG and GO terms enrichment, hub genes and so on.
